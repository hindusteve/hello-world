Did undergrad degree in CS back when Web was just becoming a thing and before mobile was anything. Needless to say, didn't learn about MVC concept, node.js, MEAN/LAMP stacks, etc. But have kept a toe in the dev pool, utilizing coding skills and understanding of programming fundamentals for various automation tasks throughout my career. Looking to make a transition back to where I started, as a full stack developer. Confident in my ability to learn, just looking for someone to take a chance.
